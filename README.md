# MALScheduler
A short personal project to experiment on the use of APIs. The app will show the currently running shows that someone watches in a schedule for ease of track.

Planned features:
-Schedule-like tracking
-Windows notifications for upcoming new episodes
-Windows notifications for missed episodes
-Personalized feed based on watchded anime
